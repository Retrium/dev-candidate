## Retrium UI/UX Engineer Project

Welcome to the Retrium UI/UX Engineer Project!

For this project, you will spend a couple hours implementing an interactive prototype of a Safety Check activity to satisfy some Jobs to Be Done for hypothetical users. Afterward, you will conduct a mob prototyping session with Retrium engineers to further iterate on the prototype. This project is meant to show us your approach to UI/UX design and your chops for prototyping in React. This project is not for usage within Retrium; this is a step in the interview process, not a request for free labor.

### What are you building?

You will be creating a prototype in React for a facilitation activity that allows participants in a retrospective to rate their [psychological safety](https://www.retrium.com/ultimate-guide-to-agile-retrospectives/psychological-safety#:~:text=%22Psychological%20safety%20is%20a%20belief,questions%2C%20concerns%20or%20mistakes.%22) from 1 - 5. This is typically called a [Safety Check](https://www.retrium.com/blog/what-to-do-when-people-dont-feel-safe-in-the-retrospective). The activity will begin with one facilitator (the user tasked with leading and running the activity), and up to 50 participants. For the purposes of this project, we can assume this is a standalone activity, although it is usually used as part of a larger retrospective.

The prototype should enable the following [Jobs to Be Done](https://jtbd.info/2-what-is-jobs-to-be-done-jtbd-796b82081cca):

Facilitator: **Empower me to adapt my retrospective plan to address the team’s needs.**
Participants: **Empower me to honestly describe my feelings without fear or self-consciousness.**

Feel free to make choices about the look and feel of the activity. In addition to the Jobs to Be Done, the only requirements are:

- Participants should be able to rate their psychological safety from 1 - 5.
- Facilitators should be able to see the results of the users’ submissions.
- Facilitators should receive a recommendation on how to handle the results.

You will be provided with a shell application that contains all of the data-layer functionality you will need for this task, as well as a basic React installation. Inside of the shell, you will be able to impersonate a facilitator or a participant. Feel free to install any additional libraries if you so choose. As this is a prototype, we’re not looking for pristine production-ready code, but keep in mind that we’ll be working hands-on with it in the mob prototyping session.

### The Project

You will be submitting this project on CodeSandbox. The `sandbox.config.json` file tells CodeSandbox to spin up a Node.js container for you to write your code. The project is already configured to use [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), so you can use the latest and greatest JavaScript features without wasting valuable setup time, or worrying about matters of style. The container also watches your files and continually rebuilds your prototype. So whenever you're ready, click on the link below, and then click the "Fork" button to get started. When you're finished, simply copy the sandbox URL from the browser, and email it back to us.

After we’ve had a chance to review the prototype, we’ll schedule a mob prototyping session between you and a few Retrium engineers. In this session, you’ll demo your prototype to us and gather feedback. Then, together, we will collaboratively iterate on the prototype. We might touch aspects like design, UX, or possibly add features. The mob prototyping session is where we get to learn how your design brain works, and you get to learn how we typically create user experiences through collaboration.

Good luck, and let the project begin!
